## How It Works

### Description: 
Timetracker allows study participants to record data themselves. To ensure that study participants can easily record and capture the social context of the study area, the app was developed in close collaboration with farmers. To guarantee that populations with low or no literacy can participate, the app works only with pictures; data recording was designed to be as simple as possible to allow study participants with no experience with mobile phones or smartphones to effectively and easily use the app and to make sure that study participants do not develop “entry fatigue,” losing the motivation to carefully record data. 

#### 1. Obtaining informed consent:
Review the informed consent form with the participant and answer any questions as needed. 

### 2. Entering the participant’s household ID, date, and consent
Access the app Settings screen as follows:
1.	Tap the bar that says “Activity” at the top of the screen 10 times in a row. This will take you to the app settings. In the appropriate fields, enter:
a.	The participant’s household ID
b.	Today’s date
c.	If the participant has provided informed consent, check the box for consent.
2.	Tap the image of the arrow to return to the main Activity screen.

Note that the Settings screen is only for HAPIN staff. The participant should not access the Settings screen.

### 3. Measuring time use through the TimeTracker App:
First, explain to the participant that the purpose of the app is to collect data on their activities over a 24-hour period. Emphasize that the participant should not change their activities for the sake of the research, but should do whatever activities they would normally do over the next 24 hours and track them using the app. 

Train the participant to use the app: 
1.	From the home screen on the phone, show the participant how to tap the icon for the TimeTracker app to begin using the app.
2.	Review the app images one-by-one with the participant, using the printed app manual as a visual aid and showing the participant each image within the app.
a.	Carefully go one-by-one through the activities on the printed app manual to ensure that the participant understands what each image is representing.
3.	Explain to the participant that before she begins any activity, she should press and HOLD the image that best matches what she will be doing. She will then see the time beginning to record in the upper left-hand corner (activity will be green). 
 
4.	Next, explain that when the user is finished with an activity, the participant should simply press and HOLD the same image again to end the recording. She will need to need to do this for every activity she does throughout the next 24 hours. 
a.	The app can accommodate up to three simultaneous activities. If the participant is doing multiple activities at once (e.g. cooking, washing dishes, and childcare), she can track each of those activities at the same time.
b.	If the participant forgets to record an activity using the app, she should try to remember the activity and the approximate duration, and note it down on a piece of paper if possible. She should then report it to the HAPIN field worker who comes to pick up the phone. 
c.	Similarly, if the participant forgets to end an activity in the app at the correct time, accidentally selects the wrong activity, or makes any other mistake, she should try to remember the error and note it down on a piece of paper if possible. She should then report it to the HAPIN field worker who comes to pick up the phone. 
5.	For eating, there are additional steps that participants need to follow. Before she begins eating a meal, she should press and HOLD the eating picture (example shown below). When she is finished eating, press and HOLD the same picture again.
 
6.	She will see 4 different plates showing different portion sizes, which either fill a quarter, a half, three-quarters, or a full plate. She should try to choose the picture that best matches her plate (the selected one will be green). Then, select the red OK button.
 
7.	On the next screen, she can swipe up and down to select all of the foods groups she just ate, which can include: vegetables, fruits, dairy, meat, and more. She should try to match her selection to what was on her plate as much as possible. If she ate a full spoonful or more of something from that food group, then she should include it. Then select the red OK button. She can now choose her next activity.
 
8.	To test the participant’s comprehension, point to different images on the app manual and ask her what activity the image represents. Also, go through some example scenarios, such as: 
a.	Aisha does some sweeping (cleaning), then helps her elderly mother-in-law to get dressed, and then goes to the market stand to buy some vegetables. Which pictures would she select?
9.	Finally, once you are confident that the participant understands and is comfortable with the app, explain that you will return the next day to pick up the phone, and that the participant should continue tracking her activities until you return.
a.	Remind her that if she leaves the house, she should bring the smartphone with her and track her activities while she is away from home. However, if this is not possible (e.g. because the phone is likely to get wet or stolen), then she should try to remember her activities and how long they took, and then she should report these to the HAPIN field worker who comes to pick up the phone.

4. Collect the smartphone
The next day, when you return to the household, ask the participant whether there are any changes to be made. 

Making changes in the app:
1.	If the participant says that they made a mistake in tracking their activities (e.g. forgot to begin or end an activity at the correct time, or selected the wrong activity), these changes should be made before completing the household visit.
2.	Access the Settings screen and scroll down to the bottom of the screen. Select the option to enter editable mode. This will allow you to go to the Day View screen and make changes, including adding or deleting activities as needed.
3.	Ask the participant whether any other changes should be made. Repeat this process until the participant says that there are no further changes.
